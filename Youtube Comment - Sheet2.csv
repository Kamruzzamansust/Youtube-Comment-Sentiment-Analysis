@hachimanhikigaya3610,"I&#39;m a tester and I was introduced to testing gen ai applications. In the process I was asked to learn about gen ai, llms, and prompt engineering. When I dive right into learning all these things i was so confused as I don&#39;t have any previous knowledge on machine learning/ai. Please guide me on what pre requisites I should have before starting these in the context of testing",2024-07-11T03:20:36Z,0,0,,,,
